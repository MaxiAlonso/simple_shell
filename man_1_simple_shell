Description

A simple version of the basic shell, which is a Unix command line interpreter that reads standar input commands and executes them.
As it is a simple version the functionality is limited to certains built-in functions.
It was created for the end of trimester project fo Holberton School.

Invocation

An intereactive simple shell can be called by typing ./hsh. Meanwhile a non intereactive is invoked via a pipe, for example echo ls | .hsh

Command execution

After a command has been received, if it is a simple one and an optional list of arguments, the following steps will be taken.

If the command does not contain any slashes, the shell looks for function that goes by that name and invokes it. If a macth is not found, the shell search for it in the built-ins, and in the case its founds it there, the built-in is invoked.

But if it there is no match at this point, the shell will look into each element of the environmnet variable PATH for a directory containing an executable file in which the name is found. At this point, if the search bring no results, the shell prints an error message.

Built-ins
